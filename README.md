Greetings, adventurer!

The sum of all human knowledge awaits you. You are about to enter the
dungeons rumored to contain structures and systems to order the things
in this world.

You, a newly trained initiate and an eager seeker of knowledge, are 
determined to bring order to the things lurking in the dungeons of 
knowledge, or die in the attempt. Your hour of destiny has come. 
For the sake of us all: Go bravely!

How to play
===========

This is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game, a role-playing video game
characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game
levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and possibly permanent death of
the player-character.

Items in the dungeon, known as entities, are generated from
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), a free and
open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and
machines.

The dungeon also contains strange animals that seem to have escaped from
the pages of [a certain Chinese encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge).
Running into these animals will raise your level of confusion and
decrease your sanity, so it seems best to avoid them.

Once you have discovered an entity box, you can loot it and see what is
inside. Press the `space` key to explore.

Movement through the dungeon is possible with the cursor keys or like a
video game player (`WASD`) or even an old school adventurer (`hjkl`).

A copy of the game can be played online at <a href="http://www.johl.io/dungeonofknowledge/">http://www.johl.io/dungeonofknowledge/</a>.
