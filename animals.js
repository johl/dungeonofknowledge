“This book first arose out of a passage in [Jorge Luis] Borges, out
of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the
familiar landmarks of my thought—our thought that bears the stamp
of our age and our geography—breaking up all the ordered surfaces
and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild
profusion of existing things, and continuing long afterwards to
disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old distinction between
the Same and the Other. This passage quotes a ‘certain Chinese
encyclopaedia’ in which it is written that ‘animals are divided
into:

1. Those that belong to the emperor
2. Embalmed ones
3. Those that are trained
4. Suckling pigs
5. Mermaids (or Sirens)
6. Fabulous ones
7. Stray dogs
8. Those that are included in this classification
9. Those that tremble as if they were mad
10. Innumerable ones
11. Those drawn with a very fine camel hair brush
12. Et cetera
13. Those that have just broken the flower vase
14. Those that, at a distance, resemble flies´

In the wonderment of this taxonomy, the thing we
apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable,
is demonstrated as the exotic charm of another system of thought,
is the limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of thinking
that.”

Michel Foucault, The Order of Things (New York: Pantheon, 1970) xv.
